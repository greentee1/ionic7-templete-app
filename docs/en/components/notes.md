# Notes

 > This component is designed to manage notes in an Angular application. It allows users to add, edit, and delete text notes, making it easy and convenient to interact. 

> The development of this component uses key HTML elements and Angular directives that provide functionality and visualization. The main elements include: 

- <ion-list> - is used to display a list of notes, each of which is represented by an element <ion-item>.
- *ngFor is a structural directive for rendering a list of notes obtained from an array of notes.
- <ion-button> - buttons for saving a new note, deleting an existing note, and switching to editing mode.
- <ion-item> is the main element of the list, which is a container for each individual note.
- <ion-reorder> is a user interface component in the Ionic framework that allows you to change the order of items in a list using drag and drop gestures.

# ToDo for the future:

- Added data storage in Local Storage
- When the modified notes save the state (isActive) in Local Storage
- When new data is added (via the "+" button or by pressing Enter), they are sorted and can be moved up or down the list with a change in their sequence number (order)
- Data can be changed by clicking on it
- When you select a note (via the checkbox), a delete button will appear. If you select several notes, you can delete them all via the "Delete all completed notes" button
- It is necessary to correct the change of existing notes. Now, when you change the note data, they are updated and a new note with the same data appears.
- You need to create a data save in Firebase
